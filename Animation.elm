-- RUNNING


{-| Runs an animation for some time. If you need to know when the animation
"ends early", leaving time to spare, consider using [`animate`](#animate)
instead.

the animation.

For negative values you'll get the zero interval.

For negative values you'll get the zero interval.

to use a function with multiple arguments, you're looking for
[`andMap`](#andMap)

{-| Applies functions produced by one animation to values produced by another
one. In tandem with [`map`](#map), this allows you to combine several animations
using a multiple-parameter function.
